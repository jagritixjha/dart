/*  
  ----- Encapsulation means hiding data within a library, preventing it from outside factors. 
  It helps you control your program and prevent it from becoming too complicated.
  ---- Dart doesnâ€™t support keywords like public, private, and protected. Dart uses _ (underscore) to make a property or method private.

  *** The encapsulation happens at library level, not at class level.

  ----- Encapsulation can be achieved by:
  -- Declaring the class properties as private by using underscore(_).
  -- Providing public getter and setter methods to access and update the value of private property.

  // Retrieve the values of the object using getter
  print("Id: ${emp.getId}");
  print("Name: ${emp.getName}");

  // Private properties

  String? _name;

// Getter method to access private property _id & property _name
